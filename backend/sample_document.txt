Machine Learning Fundamentals

What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data.

The field of machine learning combines computer science and statistics to harness the power of data. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to "learn" information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases.

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a training dataset where each example has a corresponding label or target value. The algorithm learns a mapping function from input variables to output variables.

Common supervised learning algorithms include:
- Linear Regression: Used for continuous value prediction
- Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems
- Decision Trees: Used for both classification and regression
- Support Vector Machines: Effective for high-dimensional data
- Neural Networks: Powerful for complex pattern recognition

Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data without predefined labels. These algorithms are used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

Popular unsupervised learning techniques include:
- K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into k clusters
- Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a tree of clusters
- Principal Component Analysis: Reduces dimensionality
- DBSCAN: Density-based clustering algorithm

Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines labeled and unlabeled data for training. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming but unlabeled data is readily available.

Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

Key Concepts in Machine Learning

Features and Labels

Features are the input variables used to make predictions. Labels are the output variables we're trying to predict. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.

Training and Testing

Machine learning models are typically trained on a training dataset and evaluated on a separate testing dataset. This separation prevents overfitting and provides a realistic estimate of model performance.

Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and peculiarities. This results in poor performance on new data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

Model Evaluation Metrics

Different metrics are used to evaluate machine learning models depending on the task:
- Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions
- Precision: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives
- Recall: Proportion of true positives among actual positives
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Mean Squared Error: Average squared difference for regression
- ROC-AUC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
